# Swiss knife to create workflows with ComfyUI and Train models with Ostris Ai Toolkit
This is a fork of [ComfyUI_with_Flux](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ComfyUI_with_Flux)

## Improvements: 

Soft linked the folders ***/workspace/models*** that can be synced with Google Cloud Storage, AWS or any other available on Runpod.  

The deployment is faster and keeps weights safe in external network storage.
